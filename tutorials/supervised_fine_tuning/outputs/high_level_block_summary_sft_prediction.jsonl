The module also features internal signals and components such as registers, wires, a multiplexer, and a buffer. The flip-flop behavior is controlled by the clock and data enable signals and is power-gated based on the VPWR input. The operation of the module can be further understood by considering the behavior of the internal signals and components as per their connection and usage within the module.\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule sky130_fd_sc_ls__edfxtp (Q ,CLK ,D ,DE ,VPWR,VGND,VPB ,VNB);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\"}}\"", "pred": "\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"10\",\n        \"text\":", "label": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  output Q ; \\\\n  input CLK ; \\\\n  input D ; \\\\n  input DE ; \\\\n  input VPWR; \\\\n  input VGND; \\\\n  input VPB ; \\\\n  input VNB ; \\\\n  wire buf_Q ; \\\\n  reg notifier ; \\\\n  wire D_delayed ; \\\\n  wire DE_delayed ; \\\\n  wire CLK_delayed; \\\\n  wire mux_out ; \\\\n  wire awake ; \\\\n  wire cond0 ; \\\\n  sky130_fd_sc_ls__udp_mux_2to1 mux_2to10 (mux_out, buf_Q, D_delayed, DE_delayed ); \\\\n  sky130_fd_sc_ls__udp_dff$P_pp$PG$N dff0 (buf_Q , mux_out, CLK_delayed, notifier, VPWR, VGND); \\\\n  assign awake = ( VPWR === 1'b1 ); \\\\n  assign cond0 = ( awake && ( DE_delayed === 1'b1 ) ); \\\\n  buf buf0 (Q , buf_Q ); \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 7764}

Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\n\\\\nThis Verilog module is a master controller for an LED display. It implements a state machine with two states: CREATE_FRAME and WAIT_FLIP. The module takes inputs from the clock and reset signals, and outputs data for the LED display. The state machine controls the timing and color patterns for the LED display. It updates the state, color values, and other control signals based on the current state and certain conditions.\\\\n\\\\nThe CREATE_FRAME state handles the creation of frames for the LED display. It updates the x and y coordinates, sets the valid and flip signals, and changes the color values for the LED display. The WAIT_FLIP state waits for the display to flip and then transitions back to the CREATE_FRAME state.\\\\n\\\\nThe state machine transitions on the positive edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is asserted, the state is set to CREATE_FRAME, and the x, y, and other state variables are initialized. Otherwise, the state machine updates its internal state and other variables based on the current state and the values of certain signals.\\\\n\\\\nThe LED display is controlled by the outputs d1_c, d1_r, d1_g, d1_b, d2_c, d2_r, d2_g, and d2_b, which receive the color data and control signals from the module.\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule mstr_ctrl(input clk,input rst,output [7:0]d1_c,output [7:0]d1_r,output [7:0]d1_g,output [7:0]d1_b,output [7:0]d2_c,output [7:0]d2_r,output [7:0]d2_g,output [7:0]d2_b);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\"}}\"", "pred": "\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"10000000", "label": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n localparam STATE_SIZE = 1; \\\\n localparam CREATE_FRAME = 1'b0, \\\\n  WAIT_FLIP = 1'b1; \\\\n reg [STATE_SIZE-1:0] state_d, state_q; \\\\n reg [3:0] x_d, x_q; \\\\n reg [2:0] y_d, y_q; \\\\n reg [7:0] red_d, red_q; \\\\n reg [7:0] green_d, green_q; \\\\n reg [7:0] blue_d, blue_q; \\\\n reg valid_d, valid_q; \\\\n reg flip_d, flip_q; \\\\n wire flipped; \\\\n reg wait_fft_d, wait_fft_q; \\\\n led_display led_display (.clk(clk),.rst(rst),.x(x_q),.y(y_q),.red(red_q),.green(green_q),.blue(blue_q),.valid(valid_q),.flip(flip_q),.flipped(flipped),.d1_c(d1_c),.d1_r(d1_r),.d1_g(d1_g),.d1_b(d1_b),.d2_c(d2_c),.d2_r(d2_r),.d2_g(d2_g),.d2_b(d2_b)); \\\\n always @(*) begin \\\\n  state_d = state_q; \\\\n  red_d = 8'h00; \\\\n  green_d = 8'h00; \\\\n  blue_d = 8'h00; \\\\n  flip_d = 1'b0; \\\\n  valid_d = 1'b0; \\\\n  x_d = x_q; \\\\n  y_d = y_q; \\\\n  wait_fft_d = 1'b0; \\\\n  case (state_q) \\\\n  CREATE_FRAME: begin \\\\n  wait_fft_d = ~wait_fft_q; \\\\n  if (wait_fft_q) begin \\\\n  x_d = x_q + 1'b1; \\\\n  if (x_q == 4'b1111) begin \\\\n  y_d = y_q + 1'b1; \\\\n  if (y_q == 3'b111) begin \\\\n  valid_d = 1'b0; \\\\n  flip_d = 1'b1; \\\\n  state_d = WAIT_FLIP; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  valid_d = ~wait_fft_q; \\\\n  if (x_d == 4'b0010) begin \\\\n  red_d = 8'hff; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (x_d == 4'b0100) begin \\\\n  blue_d = 8'hff; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (x_d == 4'b1000) begin \\\\n  green_d = 8'hff; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  WAIT_FLIP: begin \\\\n  if (flipped) begin \\\\n  state_d = CREATE_FRAME; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  endcase \\\\n end \\\\n always @(posedge clk) begin \\\\n  if (rst) begin \\\\n  state_q <= CREATE_FRAME; \\\\n  x_q <= 4'b0; \\\\n  y_q <= 3'b0; \\\\n  end else begin \\\\n  state_q <= state_d; \\\\n  x_q <= x_d; \\\\n  y_q <= y_d; \\\\n  end \\\\n  wait_fft_q <= wait_fft_d; \\\\n  red_q <= red_d; \\\\n  green_q <= green_d; \\\\n  blue_q <= blue_d; \\\\n  valid_q <= valid_d; \\\\n  flip_q <= flip_d; \\\\n end \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 6303}

The output assignment connects the input signals to the synchronous registers based on the clock and reset signals, implementing a synchronizing function for the input data.\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule dcfifo_32in_32out_16kb_synchronizer_ff (D,Q,rd_clk,\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] );\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\"}}\"", "pred": "\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"10000000", "label": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  output [8:0]D; \\\\n  input [8:0]Q; \\\\n  input rd_clk; \\\\n  input [0:0]\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ; \\\\n  wire [8:0]Q; \\\\n  wire [8:0]Q_reg; \\\\n  wire [0:0]\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ; \\\\n  wire rd_clk; \\\\n  assign D[8:0] = Q_reg; \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[0] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[0]),.Q(Q_reg[0])); \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[1] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[1]),.Q(Q_reg[1])); \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[2] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[2]),.Q(Q_reg[2])); \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[3] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[3]),.Q(Q_reg[3])); \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[4] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[4]),.Q(Q_reg[4])); \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[5] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[5]),.Q(Q_reg[5])); \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[6] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[6]),.Q(Q_reg[6])); \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[7] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[7]),.Q(Q_reg[7])); \\\\n  (* ASYNC_REG *) \\\\n  (* KEEP = \\\\\\\"yes\\\\\\\" *) \\\\n FDCE #(.INIT(1'b0)) \\\\n  \\\\\\\\Q_reg_reg[8] \\\\n (.C(rd_clk),.CE(1'b1),.CLR(\\\\\\\\ngwrdrst.grst.g7serrst.rd_rst_reg_reg[1] ),.D(Q[8]),.Q(Q_reg[8])); \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 9885}
