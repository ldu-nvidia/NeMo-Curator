Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\nHere are block level summaries:\\\\n\\\\nblock_0: The block_0 code defines the parameter RST_CNT_SIZE as 8. It also declares a power-on reset counter and a reset counter for RZ, both with a size of RST_CNT_SIZE. Additionally, it creates a power-on reset signal called poweron_rst_n using the poweron_rst_cnt.\\\\nblock_1: The block_1 code creates a reset signal for RZ called rz_rst_n using the rz_rst_cnt. It also declares a register z80_rst2 for the reset signal for Z80, and a register z80_halted for the Z80 halt signal. The initial block sets the initial value for the power-on reset counter to 0.\\\\nblock_2: The block_2 code contains an always block that increments the power-on reset counter on the positive edge of the clk_24mhz signal. It also assigns the ZXBus reset signal (zxbus_rst_n) to the power-on reset signal (poweron_rst_n). Additionally, there is another always block that checks for the active power-on reset and updates the ZXBus reset signal accordingly.\\\\nblock_3: The block_3 code checks if the power-on reset is active, and if so, it sets the RZ reset counter to 0. It then checks if initialization is active, and if so, it also sets the RZ reset counter to 0. Finally, it checks if the RZ reset is active.\\\\nblock_4: The block_4 code increments the RZ reset counter. It also includes an always block that checks for the active RZ reset and sets the Z80 reset signal to 0 when the RZ reset is active. Additionally, it begins the RZ reset process by setting the Z80 reset signal to 0.\\\\nblock_5: The block_5 code sets the Z80 reset signal to 0 and ends the RZ reset process. It then begins the Z80 reset process by setting the Z80 reset signal to the value of z80_rst2.\\\\nblock_6: The block_6 code sets the Z80 reset signal to 1 and ends the Z80 reset process. It then includes an always block that checks for the active Z80 reset and sets the Z80 bus request signal to 1 when the Z80 reset is active.\\\\nblock_7: The block_7 code checks for the active Z80 reset and sets the Z80 bus request signal to 0 when the Z80 reset is active. It also includes an always block that checks for the active RZ reset and sets the Z80 halted signal to 0 when the RZ reset is active.\\\\nblock_8: The block_8 code checks if the Z80 halted signal is 1, and if so, it sets the Z80 halted signal to 0. It also includes an always block that checks for the active RZ reset and sets the Z80 bus request signal to 0 when the RZ reset is active. Additionally, it initializes the Z80 bus request signal.\\\\nblock_9: The block_9 code sets the ROM reset signal to 0 and the initialization in progress signal to 1. It then checks if the Z80 halted signal is 1 and initializes the Z80 bus request signal.\\\\nblock_10: The block_10 code sets the ROM reset signal to 1 and the initialization in progress signal to 0, ending the module.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule reset (input wire clk_fpga,input wire clk_24mhz,input wire init,output reg init_in_progress,output wire zxbus_rst_n,output reg rom_rst_n,output reg z80_rst_n,output reg z80_busrq_n,input wire z80_busak_n);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\",\\\"\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n parameter RST_CNT_SIZE = 8; \\\\n  reg [RST_CNT_SIZE:0] poweron_rst_cnt; \\\\n  reg [RST_CNT_SIZE:0] rz_rst_cnt; \\\\n  wire poweron_rst_n = poweron_rst_cnt[RST_CNT_SIZE]; \\\\n  wire rz_rst_n = rz_rst_cnt[RST_CNT_SIZE]; \\\\n  reg z80_rst2; \\\\n  reg [1:0] z80_halted; \\\\n  initial \\\\n  poweron_rst_cnt <= 'd0; \\\\n  always @(posedge clk_24mhz) \\\\n  if( !poweron_rst_n ) \\\\n  poweron_rst_cnt <= poweron_rst_cnt + 'd1; \\\\n  assign zxbus_rst_n = poweron_rst_n; \\\\n  always @(posedge clk_24mhz, negedge poweron_rst_n) \\\\n  if( !poweron_rst_n ) \\\\n  rz_rst_cnt <= 'd0; \\\\n  else if( init ) \\\\n  rz_rst_cnt <= 'd0; \\\\n  else if( !rz_rst_n ) \\\\n  rz_rst_cnt <= rz_rst_cnt + 'd1; \\\\n  always @(posedge clk_fpga, negedge rz_rst_n) \\\\n  if( !rz_rst_n ) \\\\n  begin \\\\n  z80_rst_n <= 1'b0; \\\\n  z80_rst2 <= 1'b0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else \\\\n  begin \\\\n  z80_rst_n <= z80_rst2; \\\\n  z80_rst2 <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  always @(posedge clk_fpga, negedge z80_rst_n) \\\\n  if( !z80_rst_n ) \\\\n  z80_busrq_n <= 1'b1; \\\\n  else \\\\n  z80_busrq_n <= 1'b0; \\\\n  always @(posedge clk_24mhz, negedge rz_rst_n) \\\\n  if( !rz_rst_n ) \\\\n  z80_halted <= 2'b00; \\\\n  else \\\\n  z80_halted[1:0] <= {z80_halted[0], ~z80_busak_n}; \\\\n  always @(posedge clk_24mhz, negedge rz_rst_n) \\\\n  if( !rz_rst_n ) \\\\n  begin \\\\n  rom_rst_n <= 1'b0; \\\\n  init_in_progress <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else if( z80_halted[1] ) \\\\n  begin \\\\n  rom_rst_n <= 1'b1; \\\\n  init_in_progress <= 1'b0; \\\\n  end \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 10963}

It also declares a register waiting and assigns the value of req based on the write_edge, read_edge, and s_address signals.\\\\nblock_2: The block_2 code assigns the value of s_waitrequest based on req, waiting, and the waitcyc signal. It also declares a wire variable mb_write_pulse and assigns the value of wr_rs based on the m_addr_ack and m_wr_rq signals. Additionally, it creates instances of the bd and bd2 modules, mc_bd0 and mb_bd1, using specific signals as inputs.\\\\nblock_3: The block_3 code assigns the value of m_mb_write based on the condition mb_write_pulse ? word : 0. It also declares a register waitcyc with a bit range of 7:0.

It then enters an \\\\\\\"else\\\\\\\" block and checks for the condition of write_edge. If write_edge is true, it enters a case statement based on the s_address signal.\\\\nblock_6: The block_6 code sets the value of addr to the first 18 bits of the s_writedata signal when s_address is 2'h0, and sets the value of m_fmc_select to the 19th bit of the s_writedata signal. Additionally, when s_address is 2'h1, it sets the value of bits 18 to 35 of the word signal to the first 18 bits of the s_writedata signal.\\\\nblock_7: The block_7 code sets the value of bits 0 to 17 of the word signal to the first 18 bits of the s_writedata signal when s_address is 2'h2.

Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\nHere are block level summaries:\\\\n\\\\nblock_0: In block_0, the code declares a 32-bit register _zz_4, a wire _zz_5, a 10-bit wire _zz_6, and a single-bit register _zz_1.\\\\nblock_1: In block_1, the code declares a 30-bit wire _zz_2, a 32-bit wire _zz_3, and three arrays of 8-bit registers (ram_symbol0, ram_symbol1, and ram_symbol2), each with 1024 elements.\\\\nblock_2: In block_2, the code declares an array of 8-bit registers (ram_symbol3) with 1024 elements, as well as four 8-bit registers (_zz_7, _zz_8, _zz_9, _zz_10).\\\\nblock_3: In block_3, the code assigns the value of _zz_5 to io_bus_cmd_ready, assigns the lower 10 bits of _zz_2 to _zz_6, and initializes the ram_symbol0 and ram_symbol1 arrays using the $readmemb function to read data from binary files.\\\\nblock_4: In block_4, the code reads memory from the binary files \\\\\\\"Murax.v_toplevel_system_ram_ram_symbol2.bin\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Murax.v_toplevel_system_ram_ram_symbol3.bin\\\\\\\" into the ram_symbol2 and ram_symbol3 arrays, respectively. Additionally, an always block is triggered by any change in signals, and it assigns the value of _zz_4 with the concatenation of _zz_10, _zz_9, _zz_8, and _zz_7.\\\\nblock_5: In block_5, there is an always block triggered by the positive edge of io_mainClk. Within this block, there is a conditional statement for writing to ram_symbol0 if certain conditions are met, and another conditional statement for writing to ram_symbol1. If the conditions are met, the value of _zz_3[7:0] is assigned to ram_symbol0 at the index _zz_6.\\\\nblock_6: In block_6, there are conditional statements for writing to ram_symbol1 and ram_symbol2 based on certain conditions. If the conditions are met, the value of _zz_3[15:8] is assigned to ram_symbol1 at the index _zz_6, and the value of _zz_3[23:16] is assigned to ram_symbol2 at the index _zz_6. Additionally, there is a conditional statement for writing to ram_symbol3 if certain conditions are met, and if so, the value of _zz_3[23:16] is assigned to ram_symbol3 at the index _zz_6.\\\\nblock_7: In block_7, there is a conditional statement for writing to ram_symbol3 based on certain conditions. If the conditions are met, the value of _zz_3[31:24] is assigned to ram_symbol3 at the index _zz_6. Additionally, there is a conditional statement for writing to ram_symbol0, and if io_bus_cmd_valid is true, the value of _zz_7 is assigned to ram_symbol0 at the index _zz_6.\\\\nblock_8: In block_8, the code assigns the value of ram_symbol0 at index _zz_6 to _zz_7, the value of ram_symbol1 at index _zz_6 to _zz_8, the value of ram_symbol2 at index _zz_6 to _zz_9, and the value of ram_symbol3 at index _zz_6 to _zz_10.\\\\nblock_9: In block_9, the code assigns the value of _zz_1 to io_bus_rsp_valid, shifts io_bus_cmd_payload_address right by 2 and assigns the result to _zz_2, assigns the value of io_bus_cmd_payload_data to _zz_3, and assigns the value of _zz_4 to io_bus_rsp_payload_data.\\\\nblock_10: In block_10, the code assigns the value of 1'b1 to _zz_5, and there is an always block triggered by the positive edge of io_mainClk or the positive edge of resetCtrl_systemReset. If resetCtrl_systemReset is true, the value of _zz_1 is assigned to 1'b0.\\\\nblock_11: In block_11, the code assigns the result of the logical operation ((io_bus_cmd_valid && _zz_5) && (! io_bus_cmd_payload_wr)) to _zz_1.

It also declares registers for operand_b_r and operand_a_r, both 33-bit wide.\\\\nblock_2: This code block declares a 32-bit wide register for result_r and creates a wire mult_inst_w based on the conditions of the input instructions inst_mul, inst_mulh, inst_mulhsu, and inst_mulhu.\\\\nblock_3: This code block is an instruction decoder that uses the input instructions inst_mulhsu and inst_mulh to determine the operand selection for operand_a_r based on the values of opcode_ra_operand_i.\\\\nblock_4: This code block is a continuation of the instruction decoder, specifically the operand selection for operand_a_r based on the values of opcode_ra_operand_i. If the instruction is not inst_mulhsu or inst_mulh, the operand_a_r is determined by setting the most significant bit to 0 and taking the lower 32 bits of opcode_ra_operand_i.\\\\nblock_5: This code block is a continuation of the instruction decoder, specifically the operand selection for operand_b_r based on the values of opcode_rb_operand_i. If the instruction is inst_mulhsu, the operand_b_r is determined by setting the most significant bit to 0 and taking the lower 32 bits of opcode_rb_operand_i. If the instruction is inst_mulh, the operand_b_r is determined by taking the most significant bit of opcode_rb_operand_i and the lower 32 bits of opcode_rb_operand_i.\\\\nblock_6: This code block is an instruction decoder for the operand selection of operand_b_r based on the values of opcode_rb_operand_i. If the instruction is not inst_mulhsu or inst_mulh, the operand_b_r is determined by setting the most significant bit to 0 and taking the lower 32 bits of opcode_rb_operand_i.

If the hold signal is active, or if the opcode is valid and matches the multiplication instruction word, then the values of operand_a_e1_q and operand_b_e1_q are updated with the values of operand_a_r and operand_b_r, respectively.\\\\nblock_9: This code block updates the value of mulhi_sel_e1_q based on the negation of the inst_mul instruction. If the inst_mul instruction is not active, then the value of operand_a_e1_q is set to 33-bit 0.\\\\nblock_10: This code block sets the values of operand_b_e1_q and mulhi_sel_e1_q to 33-bit 0 and 1-bit 0, respectively.

The calculation is performed using the multiplication operator and is triggered whenever there is a change in the input values.\\\\nblock_11: This code block selects the result based on the value of mulhi_sel_e1_q.

The result update is triggered on the positive edge of clk_i and is reset when rst_i is active.\\\\nblock_13: This code block initializes the result_e3_q to 32-bit 0. If the hold signal is not active, the result_e3_q is updated with the value of result_e2_q. The writeback_value_o is assigned the value of result_e3_q if MULT_STAGES is equal to 3, otherwise it is assigned the value of result_e2_q.

It also contains an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the i_clk signal. Inside the always block, there is a reset logic that sets the r_cur_state register to the value of PE_ELU_RST when i_RESET_KES or i_stop_dec is true.\\\\nblock_3: The block_3 code block contains an else block that sets the r_cur_state register to the value of r_nxt_state. This else block is inside an always block triggered by any change in the input signals.\\\\nblock_4: The block_4 code block begins a case statement for the register r_cur_state. Inside the PE_ELU_RST case, the r_nxt_state register is set to PE_ELU_OUT if i_EXECUTE_PE_ELU is true, otherwise it is set to PE_ELU_RST.\\\\nblock_5: The block_5 code block contains a case statement for the register r_cur_state. Inside the PE_ELU_OUT case, the r_nxt_state register is set to PE_ELU_RST. In the default case, the r_nxt_state register is also set to PE_ELU_RST.\\\\nblock_6: The block_6 code block contains the end of the PE_ELU_OUT case and the end of the case statement.

After this, it begins a new always block triggered by the positive edge of i_clk and starts a new logic block.\\\\nblock_7: The block_7 code block contains the beginning of the reset and stop decision logic. Inside this logic, the register r_v_2i_X is set to the value of D_KES_VALUE_ZERO and the output reg o_v_2i_X_deg_chk_bit is set to 0 when i_RESET_KES or i_stop_dec is true. If these conditions are not met, the else block begins.\\\\nblock_8: The block_8 code block begins a case statement for the register r_nxt_state. Inside the PE_ELU_RST case, the register r_v_2i_X is set to itself, and the output reg o_v_2i_X_deg_chk_bit is set to itself.\\\\nblock_9: The block_9 code block contains the logic for the PE_ELU_OUT case.

The enable16 counter is enabled when the counter reaches the specified value.\\\\nblock_2: The code block initializes the enable16_counter with the value of the divisor minus 1. It also declares two register variables, uart_rx1 and uart_rx2, for the receive buffer.\\\\nblock_3: The code block defines a process triggered by the positive edge of the sys_clk signal. Within this process, the uart_rx1 register variable is assigned the value of uart_rx, and the uart_rx2 register variable is assigned the value of uart_rx1. Additionally, a register variable rx_busy is declared for the receive busy signal.\\\\nblock_4: The code block initializes the receive counter, receive bit count, and receive register as 4-bit and 8-bit register variables, respectively. It also defines a process triggered by the positive edge of the sys_clk signal, with a reset condition for the sys_rst signal.\\\\nblock_5: The code block sets the rx_done and rx_busy signals to 0, and resets the rx_count16 and rx_bitcount variables to 0.\\\\nblock_6: The code block sets the rx_done signal to 0. If the enable16 counter is enabled, it checks if the rx_busy signal is not active, and if uart_rx2 is not active. If both conditions are met, it sets the rx_busy signal to active.\\\\nblock_7: The code block sets the rx_count16 to 7 and rx_bitcount to 0 when the else condition is met. When the else condition is not met, it increments the rx_count16 by 1.\\\\nblock_8: The code block checks if the receive count is 0, and if so, increments the receive bit count. It then checks if the receive bit count is 0, and if so, checks the value of uart_rx2 and sets the rx_busy signal to inactive if uart_rx2 is active.\\\\nblock_9: The code block checks if the receive bit count is 9, and if so, sets the rx_busy signal to inactive. It then checks the value of uart_rx2 and, if uart_rx2 is active, sets the rx_data to the value of rx_reg and sets the rx_done signal to active.\\\\nblock_10: The code block updates the receive register by combining the value of uart_rx2 with the upper 7 bits of the current value of rx_reg. It then sets the rx_reg to this combined value. After this, it increments the transmit bit count.\\\\nblock_11: The code block initializes the transmit data register, tx_busy, and tx_bitcount, which is a 4-bit register variable.\\\\nblock_12: The code block initializes the transmit count as a 4-bit register variable and the transmit register as an 8-bit register variable. It also defines a process triggered by the positive edge of the sys_clk signal, with a reset condition for the sys_rst signal. When the reset condition is met, the tx_done signal is set to 0.\\\\nblock_13: The code block sets the transmit busy signal to inactive and sets the uart_tx signal to active. In the else clause, it sets the transmit done signal to inactive and, if the tx_wr signal is active, it performs a write operation for the transmit data.\\\\nblock_14: The code block sets the transmit register to the value of tx_data, clears the transmit bitcount to 0, sets the transmit count to 1, sets the transmit busy signal to active, and sets the uart_tx signal to inactive.\\\\nblock_15: The code block displays the transmit data in a simulation environment (if the simulation flag is enabled). It then checks if the enable16 signal is true and the transmit is busy, and if both conditions are met, it increments the transmit count by 1.\\\\nblock_16: The code block checks if the transmit count is 0, and if so, increments the transmit bitcount. It then checks if the transmit bitcount is 8. If the transmit bitcount is 8, it sets the uart_tx signal to 1. If the transmit bitcount is 9, it performs the next set of operations.\\\\nblock_17: The code block sets the uart_tx signal to 1, the tx_busy signal to 0, and the tx_done signal to 1 when the else condition is met. If the else condition is not met, it sets the uart_tx signal to the value of the least significant bit of the tx_reg register variable.\\\\nblock_18: The code block updates the transmit register by shifting its bits to the left and inserting a 0 in the most significant bit position.\\\\nblock_19: The code block closes the module definition for the uart_transceiver module.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule uart_transceiver(input sys_rst,input sys_clk,input uart_rx,output reg uart_tx,input [15:0] divisor,output reg [7:0] rx_data,output reg rx_done,input [7:0] tx_data,input tx_wr,output reg tx_done);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\",\\\"\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n reg [15:0] enable16_counter; \\\\n wire enable16; \\\\n assign enable16 = (enable16_counter == 16'd0); \\\\n always @(posedge sys_clk) begin \\\\n  if(sys_rst) \\\\n  enable16_counter <= divisor - 16'b1; \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  enable16_counter <= enable16_counter - 16'd1; \\\\n  if(enable16) \\\\n  enable16_counter <= divisor - 16'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n end \\\\n reg uart_rx1; \\\\n reg uart_rx2; \\\\n always @(posedge sys_clk) begin \\\\n  uart_rx1 <= uart_rx; \\\\n  uart_rx2 <= uart_rx1; \\\\n end \\\\n reg rx_busy; \\\\n reg [3:0] rx_count16; \\\\n reg [3:0] rx_bitcount; \\\\n reg [7:0] rx_reg; \\\\n always @(posedge sys_clk) begin \\\\n  if(sys_rst) begin \\\\n  rx_done <= 1'b0; \\\\n  rx_busy <= 1'b0; \\\\n  rx_count16 <= 4'd0; \\\\n  rx_bitcount <= 4'd0; \\\\n  end else begin \\\\n  rx_done <= 1'b0; \\\\n  if(enable16) begin \\\\n  if(~rx_busy) begin \\\\n  if(~uart_rx2) begin \\\\n  rx_busy <= 1'b1; \\\\n  rx_count16 <= 4'd7; \\\\n  rx_bitcount <= 4'd0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end else begin \\\\n  rx_count16 <= rx_count16 + 4'd1; \\\\n  if(rx_count16 == 4'd0) begin \\\\n  rx_bitcount <= rx_bitcount + 4'd1; \\\\n  if(rx_bitcount == 4'd0) begin \\\\n  if(uart_rx2) \\\\n  rx_busy <= 1'b0; \\\\n  end else if(rx_bitcount == 4'd9) begin \\\\n  rx_busy <= 1'b0; \\\\n  if(uart_rx2) begin \\\\n  rx_data <= rx_reg; \\\\n  rx_done <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end else \\\\n  rx_reg <= {uart_rx2, rx_reg[7:1]}; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n end \\\\n reg tx_busy; \\\\n reg [3:0] tx_bitcount; \\\\n reg [3:0] tx_count16; \\\\n reg [7:0] tx_reg; \\\\n always @(posedge sys_clk) begin \\\\n  if(sys_rst) begin \\\\n  tx_done <= 1'b0; \\\\n  tx_busy <= 1'b0; \\\\n  uart_tx <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end else begin \\\\n  tx_done <= 1'b0; \\\\n  if(tx_wr) begin \\\\n  tx_reg <= tx_data; \\\\n  tx_bitcount <= 4'd0; \\\\n  tx_count16 <= 4'd1; \\\\n  tx_busy <= 1'b1; \\\\n  uart_tx <= 1'b0; \\\\n `ifdef SIMULATION \\\\n  $display(\\\\\\\"UART: %c\\\\\\\", tx_data); \\\\n `endif \\\\n  end else if(enable16 && tx_busy) begin \\\\n  tx_count16 <= tx_count16 + 4'd1; \\\\n  if(tx_count16 == 4'd0) begin \\\\n  tx_bitcount <= tx_bitcount + 4'd1; \\\\n  if(tx_bitcount == 4'd8) begin \\\\n  uart_tx <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end else if(tx_bitcount == 4'd9) begin \\\\n  uart_tx <= 1'b1; \\\\n  tx_busy <= 1'b0; \\\\n  tx_done <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end else begin \\\\n  uart_tx <= tx_reg[0]; \\\\n  tx_reg <= {1'b0, tx_reg[7:1]}; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n end \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 9200}

Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\nHere are block level summaries:\\\\n\\\\nblock_0: This code block declares four registers named ED, RST, CLK, and START.\\\\nblock_1: This code block declares a register named ifft and four wires named DIImag, DIReal, DOImag, and DOReal, each with specific bit widths.\\\\nblock_2: This code block declares a wire named RDY and a 5-bit register named count. The initial block initializes the count register to 0, and then sets the CLK to 0 in an infinite loop.\\\\nblock_3: This code block contains an infinite loop that inverts the CLK signal every 5 time units and an initial block that sets ifft to 0 and ED to 1.\\\\nblock_4: This code block initializes the ED register to 1, sets the RST register to 0, initializes the count register to 0, sets the START register to 0, and then after a delay of 13 time units, sets the RST register back to 1 and the START register to 1.\\\\nblock_5: This code block sets the RST register to 0 after a delay of 43 time units, then sets the START register to 1 after a delay of 53 time units, and finally sets the START register to 0 after a delay of 12 time units. It also declares a 5-bit register named ct16.\\\\nblock_6: This code block contains an always block that triggers on the positive edge of CLK or START. When the ED signal is asserted, it sets the ct16 register to 7'b000_0000 when the START signal is asserted, and increments ct16 by 1 when the START signal is de-asserted.\\\\nblock_7: This code block defines the D_R and D_I wires to hold the real and imaginary parts of the data at the address specified by ct16. It then reads data from a ROM using the address ct16, sets DIImag to the imaginary part of the data, DIReal to the real part of the data, and performs a 16-point FFT on DIImag and DIReal. Finally, it sets DOImag and DOReal to the imaginary and real parts of the output of the FFT.\\\\nblock_8: This code block contains two always blocks. The first always block triggers on the positive edge of the RDY signal and sets the count register to 17. The second always block triggers on the positive edge of the CLK signal and decrements the count register by 1 if the count is not equal to 0.\\\\nblock_9: This code block contains a begin-end block that decrements the count register by 1 when it is not equal to 17, then displays the values of count, DOReal, and DOImag using the $display function.\\\\nblock_10: This code block contains the endmodule statement, which marks the end of the module definition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule fft16TB;\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\",\\\"\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  reg ED; \\\\n  reg RST; \\\\n  reg CLK; \\\\n  reg START; \\\\n  reg ifft; \\\\n  wire [32-1:0] DIImag; \\\\n  wire [32-1:0] DIReal; \\\\n  wire [32+3:0] DOImag; \\\\n  wire [32+3:0] DOReal; \\\\n  wire RDY; \\\\n  reg [4:0] count; \\\\n  initial \\\\n  begin \\\\n  CLK = 1'b0; \\\\n  forever #5 CLK = ~CLK; \\\\n  end \\\\n  initial \\\\n  begin \\\\n  ifft = 1'b0; \\\\n  ED = 1'b1; \\\\n  RST = 1'b0; \\\\n  count = 0; \\\\n  START = 1'b0; \\\\n  #13 RST =1'b1; \\\\n  #43 RST =1'b0; \\\\n  #53 START =1'b1; \\\\n  #12 START =1'b0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  reg [4:0] ct16; \\\\n  always @(posedge CLK or posedge START) \\\\n  if (ED) begin \\\\n  if (START) ct16 = 7'b000_0000; \\\\n  else ct16 = ct16+ 'd1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  wire [31:0] D_R,D_I; \\\\n READ_ROM32 UG( .ADDR(ct16) ,.DATA_RE(D_R), .DATA_IM(D_I)); \\\\n  assign DIImag = D_I; \\\\n  assign DIReal = D_R; \\\\n fft16 UUT(.ED(ED),.RST(RST),.CLK(CLK),.START(START),.ifft(ifft),.DIImag(DIImag),.DIReal(DIReal),.DOImag(DOImag),.DOReal(DOReal),.RDY(RDY)); \\\\n  always @(posedge RDY) \\\\n  count <= 17; \\\\n  always @(posedge CLK) \\\\n  begin \\\\n  if(count!=0) \\\\n  begin \\\\n  if(count!=17) \\\\n  $display(\\\\\\\"count:%d result real:%d imag:%d\\\\\\\",count,DOReal,DOImag); \\\\n  count = count-1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 6581}

It also sets up the initial process for the clock signal in the RAMConcur_TBV module.\\\\nblock_4: This code block creates an infinite loop that waits for the clock signal to stabilize. Within the loop, it negates the clock signal and then waits for 1 clock cycle before repeating the process. The loop continues indefinitely until the end of the stimulus is reached.\\\\nblock_5: This code block sets up an initial process to initialize the stimulus for the RAMConcur_TBV module. It declares an integer variable \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" and creates a loop that waits for 1 clock cycle. Within the loop, it waits for the negative edge of the clock signal before proceeding to the end of the loop.\\\\nblock_6: This code block sets up a loop that waits for 4 clock cycles. Within the loop, it waits for the positive edge of the clock signal, sets the write enable signal to 1, sets the address to the current value of \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\", and starts a case statement based on the value of \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\".\\\\nblock_7: This code block sets the data input \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" to different values based on the value of the loop counter \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" using a case statement. If \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" is 0, \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" is set to 3. If \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" is 1, \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" is set to 2. If \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" is 2, \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" is set to 1. Otherwise, \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" is set to 0.\\\\nblock_8: This code block ends the loop and waits for the positive edge of the clock signal. Within the loop, it sets the write enable signal to 0 at the end of the loop and waits for the positive edge of the clock signal again.\\\\nblock_9: This code block sets up a loop that waits for 4 clock cycles. Within the loop, it waits for the positive edge of the clock signal and sets the address to the current value of \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\". After the loop, it waits for the positive edge of the clock signal again.\\\\nblock_10: This code block sets the write enable signal to 1, sets the address to the current value of \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\", and starts a case statement based on the negative value of \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\". If the negative value of \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" is 0, the data input \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" is set to 3.\\\\nblock_11: This code block sets the data input \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" to different values based on the value of the loop counter \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" using a case statement. If \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" is 1, \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" is set to 2. If \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" is 2, \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" is set to 1. Otherwise, \\\\\\\"din\\\\\\\" is set to 0.\\\\nblock_12: This code block sets up a loop that waits for the positive edge of the clock signal and then sets the write enable signal to 0. After that, it begins another loop that iterates 4 times.\\\\nblock_13: This code block waits for the positive edge of the clock signal, sets the address to the current value of \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\", and then ends the simulation using the $finish command.\\\\nblock_14: This code block sets up an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal in the RAMConcur_TBV module. Within the block, it writes the address and data input to the output using the $write command, separated by a space.\\\\nblock_15: This code block writes the write enable signal, data output, and clock signal to the console output using the $write command, separated by spaces.\\\\nblock_16: This code block writes a newline character to the console output using the $write command and marks the end of the module \\\\\\\"RAMConcur_TBV\\\\\\\".

Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\nHere are block level summaries:\\\\n\\\\nblock_0: In this code block, a local parameter RAM_SIZE is defined as ADDR_WIDTH - 1. Another local parameter SLEEP_COUNT is also defined as 4. Additionally, a wire read_data of width 32 bits and a reg write_data of width 32 bits are declared.\\\\nblock_1: In this code block, a reg variable ram_adr of width RAM_SIZE is declared. There is also a reg variable en_ram and a reg variable ram_sleep of width 4 bits. The module wb_bram is instantiated with the specified parameters and connected to the signals in the module. An always block is also defined to trigger on the positive edge of the clk signal.\\\\nblock_2: In this code block, if the reset signal (rst) is asserted, the output data signal (o_wbs_dat) is set to 0, the acknowledgement signal (o_wbs_ack) is set to 0, the interrupt signal (o_wbs_int) is set to 0, and the sleep mode for the RAM (ram_sleep) is set to the value of the local parameter SLEEP_COUNT.\\\\nblock_3: In this code block, the address for the RAM (ram_adr) is set to 0, the enable signal for the RAM (en_ram) is set to 0, and the process is ended. An else block is used to handle non-acknowledged write requests, checking for acknowledgement and sleep mode.\\\\nblock_4: In this code block, the acknowledgement signal (o_wbs_ack) is cleared, and the enable signal for the RAM (en_ram) is also cleared. Following this, there is a check for the write strobe and cycle, and if both are asserted, the RAM is enabled for write operations by setting en_ram to 1.\\\\nblock_5: In this code block, the address for write operations (ram_adr) is set based on the input address (i_wbs_adr) using the RAM_SIZE parameter. It then checks for the write enable signal (i_wbs_we), and if it is asserted, the input data (i_wbs_dat) is assigned to the write_data signal. If the write enable signal is not asserted, the read data is assigned to the output signal.\\\\nblock_6: In this code block, the read data is assigned to the output signal (o_wbs_dat). It then checks if the ram_sleep variable is greater than 0, and if so, it decrements ram_sleep by 1.\\\\nblock_7: In this code block, if none of the previous conditions are met, the acknowledgement signal (o_wbs_ack) is set to 1, and the sleep mode for the RAM (ram_sleep) is set to the value of the local parameter SLEEP_COUNT. This marks the end of the module.\\\\nblock_8: In this code block, the endmodule keyword is used to mark the end of the module definition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule wb_bram #(parameter DATA_WIDTH = 32,parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 12,parameter MEM_FILE = \\\\\\\"NOTHING\\\\\\\",parameter MEM_FILE_LENGTH = 0)(input clk,input rst,input i_wbs_we,input i_wbs_stb,input i_wbs_cyc,input [3:0] i_wbs_sel,input [31:0] i_wbs_adr,input [31:0] i_wbs_dat,output reg [31:0] o_wbs_dat,output reg o_wbs_ack,output reg o_wbs_int);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\",\\\"\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n localparam RAM_SIZE = ADDR_WIDTH - 1; \\\\n localparam SLEEP_COUNT = 4; \\\\n wire [31:0] read_data; \\\\n reg [31:0] write_data; \\\\n reg [RAM_SIZE:0] ram_adr; \\\\n reg en_ram; \\\\n reg [3:0] ram_sleep; \\\\n bram#(.DATA_WIDTH (DATA_WIDTH ),.ADDR_WIDTH (ADDR_WIDTH ),.MEM_FILE (MEM_FILE ),.MEM_FILE_LENGTH (MEM_FILE_LENGTH ))br(.clk (clk ),.rst (rst ),.en (en_ram ),.we (i_wbs_we ),.write_address (ram_adr ),.read_address (ram_adr ),.data_in (write_data ),.data_out (read_data )); \\\\n always @ (posedge clk) begin \\\\n  if (rst) begin \\\\n  o_wbs_dat <= 32'h0; \\\\n  o_wbs_ack <= 0; \\\\n  o_wbs_int <= 0; \\\\n  ram_sleep <= SLEEP_COUNT; \\\\n  ram_adr <= 0; \\\\n  en_ram <= 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  if (o_wbs_ack & !i_wbs_stb)begin \\\\n  o_wbs_ack <= 0; \\\\n  en_ram <= 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (i_wbs_stb & i_wbs_cyc) begin \\\\n  en_ram <= 1; \\\\n  ram_adr <= i_wbs_adr[RAM_SIZE:0]; \\\\n  if (i_wbs_we) begin \\\\n  write_data <= i_wbs_dat; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  o_wbs_dat <= read_data; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (ram_sleep > 0) begin \\\\n  ram_sleep <= ram_sleep - 1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  o_wbs_ack <= 1; \\\\n  ram_sleep <= SLEEP_COUNT; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n end \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 3024}

The module outputs a single signal (out) of the same width DW. \\\\n\\\\nThe module uses a case statement to implement the multiplexer logic. Based on the values of the five select signals (sel4, sel3, sel2, sel1, and sel0), the case statement selects one of the five input data signals (in4, in3, in2, in1, and in0) and assigns it to the output signal (out). \\\\n\\\\nThe case statement has five cases, each corresponding to a different combination of the select signals. In each case, the corresponding input data signal is passed through a logical AND gate with the select signal to produce the output signal. For example, in the first case, when sel4 is high and the other select signals are low, the output signal out is assigned the value of in4[DW-1:0]. \\\\n\\\\nThe parameter DW allows the user to specify the width of the input and output signals, which can be useful in optimizing the design for different applications.

Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\nHere are block level summaries:\\\\n\\\\nblock_0: This code block defines the input ports for the UART receiver module, including the clock signal, reset signal, RS232 receive signal, and baud rate signal.\\\\nblock_1: This code block defines the output ports for the UART receiver module, including the start bit, received data, interrupt, and output data. It also declares internal registers for the RS232 receiver signals.\\\\nblock_2: This code block declares a wire for the negative RS232 receiver signal and contains an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal or the negative edge of the reset signal. Inside the always block, the RS232 receiver is reset when the reset signal is low, setting RS232_rx0 and RS232_rx1 to 0.\\\\nblock_3: This code block continues the always block and sets RS232_rx2 and RS232_rx3 to 0. In the else block, RS232_rx0 is set to the value of the RS232 receive signal.\\\\nblock_4: This code block continues the always block and sets RS232_rx1 to the value of RS232_rx0, RS232_rx2 to the value of RS232_rx1, and RS232_rx3 to the value of RS232_rx2.\\\\nblock_5: This code block assigns the value of the negative RS232 receiver signal based on the values of the RS232 receiver registers. It also declares registers for the start bit, a 4-bit number, and the RX interrupt. An always block triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal or the negative edge of the reset signal.\\\\nblock_6: This code block initializes the bps start register to 'z' and the RX interrupt register to 0 when the reset signal is low. In the else if block, it checks for the negative RS232 receiver signal.\\\\nblock_7: This code block sets the bps start register to 1 and the RX interrupt register to 1 when the else if condition is met. If the value of the 4-bit number is 12, the bps start register is set to 0.\\\\nblock_8: This code block clears the RX interrupt register and assigns the value of the bps start register to the bps start output. It also declares registers for the received data and temporary data.\\\\nblock_9: This code block contains an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal or the negative edge of the reset signal. Inside the always block, the RX temporary data register, num register, and RX data register are cleared when the reset signal is low.\\\\nblock_10: This code block contains an else if block that checks for the RX interrupt signal. Inside the else if block, an if block is triggered on the clock signal and increments the num register by 1. A case statement is used to check the value of the num register.\\\\nblock_11: This code block sets the values of the RX temporary data register based on the value of the num register. For example, when the value of num is 1, the first bit of the RX temporary data register is set to the value of the RS232 receive signal.\\\\nblock_12: This code block sets the values of the RX temporary data register based on the value of the num register. For example, when the value of num is 6, the sixth bit of the RX temporary data register is set to the value of the RS232 receive signal.\\\\nblock_13: This code block sets the output data to the value of the RX temporary data register. It then checks if the number of bits received is 12, and if so, it resets the number of bits received to 0 and sets the RX data register to the value of the RX temporary data register.\\\\nblock_14: This code block assigns the value of the RX data register to the RX data output. It marks the end of the module and concludes the UART receiver implementation in Verilog.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule UART_rx(clk,rst_n,bps_start,clk_bps,RS232_rx,rx_data,rx_int,data_out);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\",\\\"\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  input clk; \\\\n  input rst_n; \\\\n  input RS232_rx; \\\\n  input clk_bps; \\\\n  output bps_start; \\\\n  output [7:0] rx_data; \\\\n  output rx_int; \\\\n  output reg [7:0]data_out; \\\\n  reg RS232_rx0,RS232_rx1,RS232_rx2,RS232_rx3; \\\\n  wire neg_RS232_rx; \\\\n  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin \\\\n  if(!rst_n) begin \\\\n  RS232_rx0 <= 1'b0; \\\\n  RS232_rx1 <= 1'b0; \\\\n  RS232_rx2 <= 1'b0; \\\\n  RS232_rx3 <= 1'b0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  RS232_rx0 <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  RS232_rx1 <= RS232_rx0; \\\\n  RS232_rx2 <= RS232_rx1; \\\\n  RS232_rx3 <= RS232_rx2; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  assign neg_RS232_rx = RS232_rx3 & RS232_rx2 & ~RS232_rx1 & ~RS232_rx0; \\\\n  reg bps_start_r; \\\\n  reg [3:0] num; \\\\n  reg rx_int; \\\\n  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) \\\\n  if(!rst_n) begin \\\\n  bps_start_r <=1'bz; \\\\n  rx_int <= 1'b0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else if(neg_RS232_rx) begin \\\\n  bps_start_r <= 1'b1; \\\\n  rx_int <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else if(num==4'd12) begin \\\\n  bps_start_r <=1'b0; \\\\n  rx_int <= 1'b0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  assign bps_start = bps_start_r; \\\\n  reg [7:0] rx_data_r; \\\\n  reg [7:0] rx_temp_data; \\\\n  always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) \\\\n  if(!rst_n) begin \\\\n  rx_temp_data <= 8'd0; \\\\n  num <= 4'd0; \\\\n  rx_data_r <= 8'd0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else if(rx_int) begin \\\\n  if(clk_bps) begin \\\\n  num <= num+1'b1; \\\\n  case(num) \\\\n  4'd1: rx_temp_data[0] <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  4'd2: rx_temp_data[1] <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  4'd3: rx_temp_data[2] <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  4'd4: rx_temp_data[3] <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  4'd5: rx_temp_data[4] <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  4'd6: rx_temp_data[5] <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  4'd7: rx_temp_data[6] <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  4'd8: rx_temp_data[7] <= RS232_rx; \\\\n  default: ; \\\\n  endcase \\\\n  data_out <= rx_temp_data; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else if(num==4'd12) begin \\\\n  num <= 4'd0; \\\\n  rx_data_r <= rx_temp_data; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  assign rx_data = rx_data_r; \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 3774}

Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\nHere are block level summaries:\\\\n\\\\nblock_0: This block initializes two 24-bit registers for incrementing counters, as well as defines two clock period parameters TCLK and TCLK_DAI.\\\\nblock_1: block_1 initializes several registers for clock signals (clk and clk_dai), as well as reset signal (rst), acknowledge signal (ack_i), and data signal (data_i).\\\\nblock_2: This block instantiates modules for spdif_tx and spdif_dai, connecting their inputs and outputs to the corresponding signals and registers. It also initializes an integer variable \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\" and begins an initialization block. If the NODUMP flag is not defined, it proceeds to dump variables.\\\\nblock_3: This block sets up a dump file and dumps variables in the spdif_tx_t module. It then resets the simple_increment_ff register to 0 and sets the simple_increment_ff2 register to the maximum value of 24 bits.\\\\nblock_4: This block resets the data latch and subframe shift register in the spdif_tx_t module to zero. It also sets the clk and clk_dai signals to 0, and resets the ack_i signal to 00.\\\\nblock_5: This block sets the reset signal (rst) to 0, then waits for a period of TCLK. After that, it sets the reset signal to 1, waits for another period of TCLK, and finally sets the reset signal back to 0.\\\\nblock_6: This block waits for a period of TCLK, and then checks if the NODUMP flag is not defined. If it is not defined, it waits for 500,000 time units, finishes the simulation with a code of 2, and ends the block.\\\\nblock_7: This block includes an end statement, as well as two always blocks that toggle the clk and clk_dai signals at half the period of TCLK and TCLK_DAI, respectively. It also includes an always block triggered on the positive edge of the uut.pop_o[0] signal, which waits for a period of TCLK.\\\\nblock_8: This block assigns the upper 24 bits of the data_i register to the value of the simple_increment_ff counter. It then increments the simple_increment_ff counter by 1. If the counter reaches 256, it finishes the simulation with a code of 2. Finally, it sets the second bit of the ack_i signal to 1.\\\\nblock_9: This block includes a wait for a period of TCLK, then sets the second bit of the ack_i signal to 0. It then begins an always block triggered on the positive edge of the uut.pop_o[1] signal, which waits for a period of TCLK.\\\\nblock_10: This block sets the lower 24 bits of the data_i register to the hexadecimal value of abcdef. It then decrements the simple_increment_ff2 counter by 1. It sets the first bit of the ack_i signal to 1, waits for a period of TCLK, and then sets the first bit of the ack_i signal to 0.\\\\nblock_11: This block includes an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clk_dai signal. Within the always block, it checks the acknowledge signal from the spdif_dai module. If the acknowledge signal is true, it displays the data output in hexadecimal format and ends the always block.

If the baud_ctr register is greater than or equal to clkdiv, it resets the baud_ctr to 0. Otherwise, it increments the baud_ctr by 1. This logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal.\\\\nblock_3: The block_3 code sets the bit counter to 0 if the reset signal is active.

The rstCRC input is for reset, CRCEn is for enabling CRC, CRC5_8BitIn is an 8-bit input for CRC5, and dataIn is an 8-bit data input.\\\\nblock_1: This code block declares the clk and rst inputs for clock and reset, respectively. It also declares the CRCResult and ready outputs for the CRC result and ready signal. Additionally, it declares a wire for the rstCRC input to reset the CRC.\\\\nblock_2: This code block declares wires for the CRCEn, CRC5_8BitIn, dataIn, clk, and rst inputs. These wires are used to connect the inputs to the module and are used for enabling CRC, 8-bit CRC5 input, data input, clock input, and reset input, respectively.\\\\nblock_3: This code block declares registers for the CRCResult, ready, doUpdateCRC, data, and loopEnd outputs. These registers are used for storing the CRC result, ready signal, update CRC signal, data output, and loop end signal, respectively.\\\\nblock_4: This code block initializes a 4-bit counter 'i' and uses a clock edge trigger to define the behavior within a begin-end block. It includes a conditional statement to reset the CRC and disable CRC update when either the reset signal or the reset-CRC signal is high.\\\\nblock_5: This code block sets the initial values for the counter 'i', CRCResult, and ready signals. The counter 'i' is set to 0, CRCResult is set to 1f in hexadecimal, and ready is set to 1. This block marks the end of the initialization block.\\\\nblock_6: This code block defines the behavior for updating the CRC. It includes conditional statements to check if the CRC update is enabled and sets the ready and doUpdateCRC signals accordingly. If the CRC update is enabled, the ready signal is set to 0 and the doUpdateCRC signal is set to 1.\\\\nblock_7: This code block assigns the value of dataIn to the data output. It then checks the CRC5_8BitIn signal and sets the loopEnd signal to 7 if CRC5_8BitIn is high, marking the end of the loop.\\\\nblock_8: This code block sets the loopEnd signal to 2, marking the end of the inner loop.\\\\nblock_9: This code block increments the counter 'i' by 1 and checks the CRC. If the XOR operation between the least significant bits of CRCResult and data is 1, the CRCResult is updated and the inner loop ends.\\\\nblock_10: This code block updates the CRC result, sets the data, checks the loop end, and disables CRC update based on the value of the counter 'i' and the loopEnd signal.\\\\nblock_11: This code block resets the counter 'i' to 0 and sets the ready signal to 1, marking the end of the inner loop and the end of the module.\\\\nblock_12: This code block marks the end of the outer loop and the end of the module.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule updateCRC5 (rstCRC, CRCResult, CRCEn, CRC5_8BitIn, dataIn, ready, clk, rst);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\",\\\"\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n input rstCRC; \\\\n input CRCEn; \\\\n input CRC5_8BitIn; \\\\n input [7:0] dataIn; \\\\n input clk; \\\\n input rst; \\\\n output [4:0] CRCResult; \\\\n output ready; \\\\n wire rstCRC; \\\\n wire CRCEn; \\\\n wire CRC5_8BitIn; \\\\n wire [7:0] dataIn; \\\\n wire clk; \\\\n wire rst; \\\\n reg [4:0] CRCResult; \\\\n reg ready; \\\\n reg doUpdateCRC; \\\\n reg [7:0] data; \\\\n reg [3:0] loopEnd; \\\\n reg [3:0] i; \\\\n always @(posedge clk) \\\\n begin \\\\n  if (rst == 1'b1 || rstCRC == 1'b1) begin \\\\n  doUpdateCRC <= 1'b0; \\\\n  i <= 4'h0; \\\\n  CRCResult <= 5'h1f; \\\\n  ready <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else \\\\n  begin \\\\n  if (doUpdateCRC == 1'b0) begin \\\\n  if (CRCEn == 1'b1) begin \\\\n  ready <= 1'b0; \\\\n  doUpdateCRC <= 1'b1; \\\\n  data <= dataIn; \\\\n  if (CRC5_8BitIn == 1'b1) begin \\\\n  loopEnd <= 4'h7; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  loopEnd <= 4'h2; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  i <= i + 1'b1; \\\\n  if ( (CRCResult[0] ^ data[0]) == 1'b1) begin \\\\n  CRCResult <= {1'b0, CRCResult[4:1]} ^ 5'h14; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  CRCResult <= {1'b0, CRCResult[4:1]}; \\\\n  end \\\\n  data <= {1'b0, data[7:1]}; \\\\n  if (i == loopEnd) begin \\\\n  doUpdateCRC <= 1'b0; \\\\n  i <= 4'h0; \\\\n  ready <= 1'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n end \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 4253}

Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\nHere are block level summaries:\\\\n\\\\nblock_0: The Verilog module has five inputs and three outputs. The inputs are in0, in1, out0, out1, and out2. The outputs are out0, out1, and out2. \\\\n\\\\nThe module uses bitwise operations to assign the outputs. The first assignment operation uses the XOR (exclusive OR) function to assign the value of out0. The second assignment operation uses the OR function to assign the value of out1. The third assignment operation uses the AND (intersection) function to assign the value of out2. \\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the Verilog module takes two input values, in0 and in1, and produces three output values: out0, out1, and out2, using bitwise XOR, OR, and AND operations. \\\\n\\\\nTherefore, this Verilog module acts as a basic logic gate, implementing a simple truth table with three inputs (in0, in1, and out2) and three outputs (out0, out1, and out2). The behavior of the circuit can be described by the following truth table: \\\\n\\\\n| in0 | in1 | out0 | out1 | out2 |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\\\n| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\\\\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\\\\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\\\\n\\\\nThe first column lists the values of the input signals, while the remaining columns list the resulting output signal values. The truth table demonstrates how the circuit implements the basic logical operations of XOR, OR, and AND. \\\\n\\\\nBy examining the truth table, we can determine that out0 corresponds to the XOR operation between in0 and in1. Out1 corresponds to the OR operation between in0 and in1, and out2 corresponds to the AND operation between in0 and in1. \\\\n\\\\nIn summary, this Verilog module implements a basic logic gate that performs bitwise operations and can be used to build more complex digital circuits.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule secret(input in0, input in1, output out0, output out1, output out2);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\",\\\"\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  assign out0 = in0 ^ in1; \\\\n  assign out1 = in0 | in1; \\\\n  assign out2 = in0 & in1; \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 4412}

This is done within a state machine that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal.\\\\nblock_4: block_4 handles the write enable signal using an always block triggered by the clock and internal write enable signals. It writes the lower 16 bits of the input data to the memory array at the address captured, followed by writing the upper 16 bits to the next memory location.\\\\nblock_5: block_5 handles the read enable signal using an always block triggered by the clock and internal read enable signals. It reads the data from the memory array at the address captured and assigns it to the output register rd_data. Additionally, it includes a reset signal triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the negative edge of the reset signal.\\\\nblock_6: block_6 handles the state transitions for the state machine within the module. It sets the state to IDLE when the reset signal is active, and otherwise updates the state based on the value of the next state. Additionally, it includes a reset signal triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the negative edge of the reset signal.\\\\nblock_7: block_7 handles the reset and clear functionality for the wait state counter. It sets the wait state counter to 0 when the reset signal is active, and also clears the counter when the clear count signal is triggered.\\\\nblock_8: block_8 handles the increment of the wait state counter when none of the reset or clear conditions are met. It increments the wait state counter by 1. Additionally, it includes an always block that sets the clear count signal to 1 based on the conditions of the state, read enable, write enable, and wait state counter.\\\\nblock_9: block_9 sets the internal write enable and read enable signals to 0, and sets the next state to IDLE. It then checks the current state, and if the state is IDLE and the write enable signal is active, it begins the write state.\\\\nblock_10: block_10 sets the clear count signal to 0, sets the readiness signal to 0, and sets the next state to WRITE. If the read enable signal is active, it then begins the read state.\\\\nblock_11: block_11 handles the clear count functionality by setting the clear count signal to 0, sets the readiness signal to 0, and sets the next state to READ. If none of the previous conditions are met, it sets the readiness signal to 1.\\\\nblock_12: block_12 handles the transition to the WRITE state by checking if the wait state counter is non-zero. If so, it sets the internal write enable signal to 1 and sets the readiness signal to 1. If the wait state counter is zero, it enters the default state.\\\\nblock_13: block_13 handles the transition to the default state by setting the clear count signal to 0, setting the readiness signal to 0, and setting the next state to WRITE.

If none of the previous conditions are met, it enters the default state and clears the counter.\\\\nblock_15: block_15 sets the readiness signal to 0, sets the next state to READ, and marks the end of the WRITE state.

It also uses another assign statement to calculate the value of addr_out based on the start_burst signal and either raddr_fifo or adr_out_r. Inside an always block triggered by a positive edge of reset or clk, it checks if reset is true and if so, sets burst_r to 0.\\\\nblock_3: This code block contains logic to update the value of burst_r based on the conditions start_burst and generated_last && data_stb.

Additionally, it sets the value of left_plus_1 to 0 if reset is true.\\\\nblock_4: This code block sets the value of err_out to 0 if reset is true, otherwise it sets err_out to the value of error_w. Inside an always block triggered by a positive edge of clk, it updates the value of adr_out_r to raddr_fifo plus 1 if start_burst is true.\\\\nblock_5: This code block updates the value of adr_out_r to adr_out_r plus 1 if data_stb is true.

Do not include module, input and output definitions.\\\\n    <<\\\\\\/SYS>>\\\\n\\\\n    Implement the Verilog module based on the following block level summaries. Assume that signals are positive clock\\\\\\/clk edge triggered unless otherwise stated.\\\\nHere are block level summaries:\\\\n\\\\nblock_0: This code block declares a wire `pcm_in_long` with conditional assignment based on `en_sum`, and registers `acc`, `last`, `pcm_full`, `step`, and `diff`, all of type signed 18-bit.\\\\nblock_1: This code block declares two registers `diff_ext` and `step_full`, both of type signed 23-bit. It also contains an always block that updates the values of `diff` and `diff_ext` based on the calculation `diff = acc - last`, and extends `diff` to 22 bits with leading zeros. Finally, it assigns the value of `diff_ext` to `step_full`.\\\\nblock_2: This code block updates the value of `diff_ext` by performing left shifts on it by 1, 3, and 5. It also declares a wire `adv` which is the logical AND of `en_ch[0]` and `cur_ch[0]`.\\\\nblock_3: This code block contains an always block that resets the values of the `step`, `acc`, and `last` registers to 0 when the negative edge of the `rst_n` signal is detected.\\\\nblock_4: This code block checks if `cen` is enabled and if `match` is true. If `match` is true, it updates the value of `acc` based on the value of `cur_ch[0]`. It then checks if `adv` is true and updates the value of `step` based on the value of `step_full`.\\\\nblock_5: This code block sets the value of `last` to `acc`. It then declares a wire `overflow` which is the bitwise OR of the bits in the range `pcm_full[17:15]` and the logical negation of the bitwise AND of the bits in the range `pcm_full[17:15]`. Finally, it contains an always block for updating `pcm_full` on the positive edge of the `clk` signal or the negative edge of the `rst_n` signal.\\\\nblock_6: This code block resets the value of `pcm_full` to 0 when the negative edge of the `rst_n` signal is detected. If `cen` and `cur_ch[0]` are true, it sets the value of `pcm_full` to `last` based on the value of `en_ch`. Specifically, if `en_ch` is equal to 6'b000_001, then `pcm_full` is set to `last`.\\\\nblock_7: The code block updates the value of `pcm_full` based on the value of `step` and `en_ch`. If `en_ch` is equal to 6'b000_100 or 6'b010_000, then `pcm_full` is incremented by `step`. After the case statement, it checks for overflow.\\\\nblock_8: This code block updates the value of `pcm_out` based on the value of `pcm_full[17]`. If `pcm_full[17]` is 1, then `pcm_out` is set to 16'h8000; otherwise, `pcm_out` is set to `pcm_full[15:0]`.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule jt10_adpcm_acc(input rst_n,input clk,input cen,input [5:0] cur_ch,input [5:0] en_ch,input match,input en_sum,input signed [15:0] pcm_in,output reg signed [15:0] pcm_out);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\",\\\"\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n wire signed [17:0] pcm_in_long = en_sum ? { {2{pcm_in[15]}}, pcm_in } : 18'd0; \\\\n reg signed [17:0] acc, last, pcm_full; \\\\n reg signed [17:0] step; \\\\n reg signed [17:0] diff; \\\\n reg signed [22:0] diff_ext, step_full; \\\\n always @(*) begin \\\\n  diff = acc-last; \\\\n  diff_ext = { {5{diff[17]}}, diff }; \\\\n  step_full = diff_ext \\\\n  + ( diff_ext << 1 ) \\\\n  + ( diff_ext << 3 ) \\\\n  + ( diff_ext << 5 ); \\\\n end \\\\n wire adv = en_ch[0] & cur_ch[0]; \\\\n always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) \\\\n  if( !rst_n ) begin \\\\n  step <= 'd0; \\\\n  acc <= 18'd0; \\\\n  last <= 18'd0; \\\\n  end else if(cen) begin \\\\n  if( match ) \\\\n  acc <= cur_ch[0] ? pcm_in_long : ( pcm_in_long + acc ); \\\\n  if( adv ) begin \\\\n  step <= { {2{step_full[22]}}, step_full[22:7] }; \\\\n  last <= acc; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n wire overflow = |pcm_full[17:15] & ~&pcm_full[17:15]; \\\\n always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) \\\\n  if( !rst_n ) begin \\\\n  pcm_full <= 18'd0; \\\\n  end else if(cen && cur_ch[0]) begin \\\\n  case( en_ch ) \\\\n  6'b000_001: pcm_full <= last; \\\\n  6'b000_100, \\\\n  6'b010_000: pcm_full <= pcm_full + step; \\\\n  default:; \\\\n  endcase \\\\n  if( overflow ) \\\\n  pcm_out <= pcm_full[17] ? 16'h8000 : 16'h7fff; \\\\n  else \\\\n  pcm_out <= pcm_full[15:0]; \\\\n  end \\\\n endmodule \\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 5563}
