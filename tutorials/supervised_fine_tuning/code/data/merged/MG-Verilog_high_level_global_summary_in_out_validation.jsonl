It uses the input signals Reset_n, write_ts1, write_fts, dout, drdy, and drp_clk to control the writing of data and transitions between different states. The module has a set of local parameters that define the different states of the state machine, such as DRP_RESET, DRP_WRITE_FTS, DRP_WRITE_DONE_FTS, DRP_WRITE_TS1, DRP_WRITE_DONE_TS1, DRP_IDLE_FTS, and DRP_IDLE_TS1. \\\\n\\\\nThe module includes a clocked always block that handles the state transitions and data writing logic. It also includes a combinational always block that determines the next state and address based on the current state and address. Additionally, there are explicit assignments for the dwe, din, den, and daddr outputs based on the state machine's logic and the input signals. The state machine's transitions and data writing operations are controlled through the case statement, based on the current state and control signals. At each state, it performs specific operations, such as setting the data to be written, enabling data writes, and transitioning to the next state based on specific conditions.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this module effectively implements a complex state machine that controls the data writing process based on the input signals, state transitions, and control logic.\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule GTX_DRP_CHANALIGN_FIX_3752_V6 #(parameter TCQ = 1,parameter C_SIMULATION = 0) (output reg dwe,output reg [15:0] din,output reg den,output reg [7:0] daddr,output reg [3:0] drpstate,input write_ts1,input write_fts,input [15:0] dout,input drdy,input Reset_n,input drp_clk);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\"}}\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  reg [7:0] next_daddr; \\\\n  reg [3:0] next_drpstate; \\\\n  reg write_ts1_gated; \\\\n  reg write_fts_gated; \\\\n  localparam DRP_IDLE_FTS = 1; \\\\n  localparam DRP_IDLE_TS1 = 2; \\\\n  localparam DRP_RESET = 3; \\\\n  localparam DRP_WRITE_FTS = 6; \\\\n  localparam DRP_WRITE_DONE_FTS = 7; \\\\n  localparam DRP_WRITE_TS1 = 8; \\\\n  localparam DRP_WRITE_DONE_TS1 = 9; \\\\n  localparam DRP_COM = 10'b0110111100; \\\\n  localparam DRP_FTS = 10'b0100111100; \\\\n  localparam DRP_TS1 = 10'b0001001010; \\\\n  always @(posedge drp_clk) begin \\\\n  if ( ~Reset_n ) begin \\\\n  daddr <= #(TCQ) 8'h8; \\\\n  drpstate <= #(TCQ) DRP_RESET; \\\\n  write_ts1_gated <= #(TCQ) 0; \\\\n  write_fts_gated <= #(TCQ) 0; \\\\n  end else begin \\\\n  daddr <= #(TCQ) next_daddr; \\\\n  drpstate <= #(TCQ) next_drpstate; \\\\n  write_ts1_gated <= #(TCQ) write_ts1; \\\\n  write_fts_gated <= #(TCQ) write_fts; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  always @(*) begin \\\\n  next_drpstate=drpstate; \\\\n  next_daddr=daddr; \\\\n  den=0; \\\\n  din=0; \\\\n  dwe=0; \\\\n  case(drpstate) \\\\n  DRP_RESET : begin \\\\n  next_drpstate= DRP_WRITE_TS1; \\\\n  next_daddr=8'h8; \\\\n  end \\\\n  DRP_WRITE_FTS : begin \\\\n  den=1; \\\\n  dwe=1; \\\\n  case (daddr) \\\\n  8'h8 : din = 16'hFD3C; \\\\n  8'h9 : din = 16'hC53C; \\\\n  8'hA : din = 16'hFDBC; \\\\n  8'hB : din = 16'h853C; \\\\n  endcase \\\\n  next_drpstate=DRP_WRITE_DONE_FTS; \\\\n  end \\\\n  DRP_WRITE_DONE_FTS : begin \\\\n  if(drdy) begin \\\\n  if(daddr==8'hB) begin \\\\n  next_drpstate=DRP_IDLE_FTS; \\\\n  next_daddr=8'h8; \\\\n  end else begin \\\\n  next_drpstate=DRP_WRITE_FTS; \\\\n  next_daddr=daddr+1'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  DRP_IDLE_FTS : begin \\\\n  if(write_ts1_gated) begin \\\\n  next_drpstate=DRP_WRITE_TS1; \\\\n  next_daddr=8'h8; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  DRP_WRITE_TS1 : begin \\\\n  den=1; \\\\n  dwe=1; \\\\n  case (daddr) \\\\n  8'h8 : din = 16'hFC4A; \\\\n  8'h9 : din = 16'hDC4A; \\\\n  8'hA : din = 16'hC04A; \\\\n  8'hB : din = 16'h85BC; \\\\n  endcase \\\\n  next_drpstate=DRP_WRITE_DONE_TS1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  DRP_WRITE_DONE_TS1 : begin \\\\n  if(drdy) begin \\\\n  if(daddr==8'hB) begin \\\\n  next_drpstate=DRP_IDLE_TS1; \\\\n  next_daddr=8'h8; \\\\n  end else begin \\\\n  next_drpstate=DRP_WRITE_TS1; \\\\n  next_daddr=daddr+1'b1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  DRP_IDLE_TS1 : begin \\\\n  if(write_fts_gated) begin \\\\n  next_drpstate=DRP_WRITE_FTS; \\\\n  next_daddr=8'h8; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  endcase \\\\n  end \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 439}

This allows it to properly handle data transmission and reception through the FTDI interface.\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule ftdi (input clock,input [7:0] read_data,input read_clock_enable,input reset,input fscts,output reg ready,output reg [1:0] state,output reg fsdi);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\"}}\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  reg [9:0] data; \\\\n  reg new_data; \\\\n  reg [3:0] bit_pos; \\\\n  localparam IDLE = 2'h0, WAIT_CTS = 2'h1, DATA = 2'h2; \\\\n  always @(negedge clock or negedge reset) begin \\\\n  if (~reset) begin \\\\n  ready <= 0; \\\\n  new_data <= 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  if (state == IDLE) begin \\\\n  if (~new_data) \\\\n  if (~ready) \\\\n  ready <= 1; \\\\n  else if (read_clock_enable) begin \\\\n  data[0] <= 0; \\\\n  data[8:1] <= read_data; \\\\n  data[9] <= 1; \\\\n  new_data <= 1; \\\\n  ready <= 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  else \\\\n  new_data <= 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  always @(negedge clock or negedge reset) begin \\\\n  if (~reset) begin \\\\n  state <= IDLE; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  case (state) \\\\n  IDLE: begin \\\\n  fsdi <= 1; \\\\n  if (new_data) begin \\\\n  bit_pos <= 0; \\\\n  if (fscts) \\\\n  state <= DATA; \\\\n  else \\\\n  state <= WAIT_CTS; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  WAIT_CTS: begin \\\\n  if (fscts) \\\\n  state <= DATA; \\\\n  end \\\\n  DATA: begin \\\\n  fsdi <= data[bit_pos]; \\\\n  if (bit_pos == 9) \\\\n  state <= IDLE; \\\\n  else \\\\n  bit_pos <= bit_pos + 1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  2'h3: begin \\\\n  state <= IDLE; \\\\n  end \\\\n  endcase \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 4109}

The module contains logic for managing the enable, valid, and stall signals, and it also deals with different data widths. The internal logic calculates the fraction and exponent based on the input data and the width configurations. The valid_out and stall_out outputs are used to indicate the state of the processing, while result_fr and result_exp represent the fraction and exponent components, respectively. The module is designed to handle different configurations of the input data and properly calculate the fraction and exponent.\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule acl_fp_frexp( clock, resetn, enable, valid_in, valid_out, stall_in, stall_out, dataa, result_fr, result_exp);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\"}}\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  parameter WIDTH = 32; \\\\n  parameter HIGH_CAPACITY = 1; \\\\n  input clock, resetn; \\\\n  input enable, valid_in, stall_in; \\\\n  output valid_out, stall_out; \\\\n  input [WIDTH-1:0] dataa; \\\\n  output [WIDTH-1:0] result_fr; \\\\n  output [31:0] result_exp; \\\\n  reg c1_valid; \\\\n  wire c1_stall; \\\\n  wire c1_enable = (HIGH_CAPACITY == 1) ?

The module updates the filter states on the rising edge of the clock and sets the output signals based on the filter conditions. The module includes a generate block to handle the different number of interrupts, and it utilizes for loops and if-else statements to handle the filtering and output generation for each interrupt signal.\\\\n\\\\n Module header:\\\\n\\\\nmodule intr_filter # (parameter integer C_NUMBER = 8,parameter integer C_FILTER_CNT = 8) (input clk,input resetn,input wire intr_in0,input wire intr_in1,input wire intr_in2,input wire intr_in3,input wire intr_in4,input wire intr_in5,input wire intr_in6,input wire intr_in7,output wire intr_out0,output wire intr_out1,output wire intr_out2,output wire intr_out3,output wire intr_out4,output wire intr_out5,output wire intr_out6,output wire intr_out7);\\\\n [\\\\\\/INST]\\\\n\\\"}}\"", "output": "{\"text\":\"\\\":\\\" \\\\n  reg[C_FILTER_CNT-1:0] filter[C_NUMBER-1:0]; \\\\n  reg [C_NUMBER-1:0] intr_out; \\\\n  wire[C_NUMBER-1:0] intr_in; \\\\n  generate \\\\n  if (C_NUMBER > 0) begin \\\\n  assign intr_out0 = intr_out[0]; \\\\n  assign intr_in[0] = intr_in0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (C_NUMBER > 1) begin \\\\n  assign intr_out1 = intr_out[1]; \\\\n  assign intr_in[1] = intr_in1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (C_NUMBER > 2) begin \\\\n  assign intr_out2 = intr_out[2]; \\\\n  assign intr_in[2] = intr_in2; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  assign intr_out2 = 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (C_NUMBER > 3) begin \\\\n  assign intr_out3 = intr_out[3]; \\\\n  assign intr_in[3] = intr_in3; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  assign intr_out3 = 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (C_NUMBER > 4) begin \\\\n  assign intr_out4 = intr_out[4]; \\\\n  assign intr_in[4] = intr_in4; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  assign intr_out4 = 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (C_NUMBER > 5) begin \\\\n  assign intr_out5 = intr_out[5]; \\\\n  assign intr_in[5] = intr_in5; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  assign intr_out5 = 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (C_NUMBER > 6) begin \\\\n  assign intr_out6 = intr_out[6]; \\\\n  assign intr_in[6] = intr_in6; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  assign intr_out6 = 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  if (C_NUMBER > 7) begin \\\\n  assign intr_out7 = intr_out[7]; \\\\n  assign intr_in[7] = intr_in7; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  assign intr_out7 = 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  endgenerate \\\\n  genvar i; \\\\n  generate \\\\n  for (i = 0; i < C_NUMBER; i=i+1) begin \\\\n  always @ (posedge clk) begin \\\\n  if (resetn == 0) begin \\\\n  filter[i] <= 0; \\\\n  intr_out[i] <= 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else begin \\\\n  filter[i] <= {filter[i][C_NUMBER-2:0],intr_in[i]}; \\\\n  if (filter[i] == {C_NUMBER{1'b1}}) begin \\\\n  intr_out[i] <= 1; \\\\n  end \\\\n  else if (filter[i] == 0) begin \\\\n  intr_out[i] <= 0; \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  end \\\\n  endgenerate \\\\n endmodule\\\",\\\"description\\\":{\\\"\"", "id": 7784}
